# Credit Risk Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** for predicting credit risk using a trained Random Forest model. It allows users to input loan and borrower features and receive a risk classification with an explanation using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## Features

- Predict credit risk probability
- Classify loans as High Risk or Low Risk
- Interactive sliders and dropdowns for user inputs
- SHAP-based local and global feature explanations
- Dynamic charts showing feature importance
